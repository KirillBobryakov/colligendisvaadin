<br> The ledge results from a break, caused by a physical phenomenon associating the hardness of the stainless steel blank, the positioning of the right leaf of the cob and the depth of the engraving, all of which makes the resistance of the monetary die fragile at this level. The position of the leaf blocking the radiant thrust during the crushing of the metal and its displacement during the striking leads to rapid deterioration of the tools. This is the reason why for each year there are pieces without break at the beginning of the use of the die and pieces with break during the striking process. It is therefore not different dies but a simple manufacturing defect<br> Source: Le Franc 2019, p. 1022<br> <br>
